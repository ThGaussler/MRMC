## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
## 테스트
### 테스트2

귀도 부흐발트, 안드레아스 브레메, *Juergen KLINSMANN*, **Lothar MATTHAEUS**, Matthias SAMMER

```{r}
X <- c(1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
Y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
MEAN <- mean(c(X, Y))
MEAN
```



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
